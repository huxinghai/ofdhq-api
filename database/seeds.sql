With the advent of LoRa (Long Range) wireless transmission technology, the development of IoT applications in agriculture has become more efficient and effective. This blog explores the applications of LoRa technology in the context of smart agriculture and its benefits.<br/><br/>\n\n\n**LoRa Technology and its Advantages:**  <br/><br/>   \n  \n  \nLoRa, as a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology, has gained significant attention in recent years. It offers long-range communication capabilities, making it ideal for large-scale and geographically diverse agricultural environments. Its outstanding features include high performance, long-distance coverage, low power consumption, support for large-scale networks, and distance measurement and localization capabilities. This combination of features makes LoRa an ideal choice for the widespread adoption of IoT applications in agriculture.<br/><br/>\n\n\n**Scenario 1: Greenhouse Cultivation**<br/><br/>\n\n\nLarge-scale greenhouse cultivation often requires significant manpower and time-consuming manual management, which is prone to human errors. By implementing an IoT system, a significant amount of time and effort can be saved for managers, leading to increased efficiency. With the same workforce, multiple greenhouses can be managed effectively, ensuring precise cultivation techniques, enhancing crop quality, and increasing overall yield.<br/><br/>\n\n\nThrough an intelligent control system, crops can receive precise water and fertilizer supply based on their specific needs.

With the Cattle Capsule, farmers can proactively address health concerns and optimize breeding strategies, ultimately leading to healthier and more productive herds.<br/><br/>\n\n\n**Conclusion:**<br/><br/>\n\n\nLoRa technology holds immense potential for revolutionizing smart agriculture. From optimizing greenhouse cultivation to modernizing aquaculture practices and revolutionizing cattle health management, the applications of LoRa in agriculture are diverse and promising. By embracing IoT solutions powered by LoRa, farmers and agriculturalists can enhance efficiency, conserve resources, improve product quality, and ultimately contribute to a sustainable and thriving agricultural industry. The era of smart agriculture powered by LoRa has arrived, bringing us closer to a more connected and productive future.', 'https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/cd4f2be0-fff1fbb_ce8394845ecb4de19d10826a3f389687~mv2-20260105132033.png', 1, '2026-01-05 13:21:06', '2026-01-05 20:41:02');

The emergence of low-power wide-area networks represented by LoRa perfectly fills the gap in the market for low-power wireless connectivity.<br/><br/>\n\n\n**Since 2014, the first batch of domestic companies in China started developing LoRa-related products. After 7 years of development, LoRa has evolved from a wireless technology used in a small range to a well-known standard in the field of IoT. Its application areas and scope have also expanded continuously.**<br/><br/>\n\n\nSo, what are the new changes in the market as LoRa enters its 7th year in China?<br/><br/>\n\n\nIntroduction of a new LoRa private network protocol in China<br/><br/>\n\n\nThis year, the global market for LoRa has been rapidly expanding. According to data released by Semtech at the 2021 LoRa Innovation Application Forum, over 2.2 million LoRa-based gateways and more than 280 million LoRa-based end nodes have been deployed worldwide. LoRa or LoRaWAN deployments have covered 171 countries and regions. It is estimated that by 2026, 50% of LPWAN IoT solutions will use LoRa.<br/><br/>\n\n\nCompared to the data from January 2020, global deployments of LoRa gateways have grown 1.75 times, and the number of LoRa-based end nodes has doubled from last year. Additionally, 14 more countries and regions have started deploying LoRa or LoRaWAN.<br/><br/>\n\n\nThe rapid development of LoRa can also be seen from the financial performance of Semtech, the company that contributes the most to LoRa infrastructure. Semtech\'s financial report for the second quarter of the 2022 fiscal year showed a record-breaking net sales of $185 million, a 29% increase compared to the previous year. Signal integrity new products accounted for 39% of the revenue, wireless and sensing products accounted for 34%, and protection products accounted for 27%.\n\n![](https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/54caa022-2ff1fbb_7044305d53e14ac9b511f506a32baa38~mv2.webp)\n\nIt is worth mentioning that due to the rapid development of LoRa in the Chinese market, surpassing other countries and regions, the existing LoRaWAN protocol is no longer able to meet the demands of the Chinese market for LoRa. In response to this, Semtech has developed a new LoRa private network protocol specifically for the Chinese market. \"This protocol and solution will be provided free of charge to LoRa ecosystem partners to support everyone in achieving the best results and help projects land as soon as possible,\" said Zhang Hui, a representative from Semtech.<br/><br/>\n\n\nFurthermore, at the 2021 LoRa Innovation Application Forum, Semtech made commitments to the Chinese market, including strengthening research and development and technical support to meet the evolving needs of Chinese customers, introducing end-to-end solutions to reduce customer product development cycles and costs, and expanding the capabilities of the supply chain to ensure leading product quality and minimize risks and losses resulting from trade disputes.<br/><br/>\n\n\nIndustrial market growth and increasing specialized application scenarios<br/><br/>\n\n\nLoRa is not the only dominant player in the field of low-power wide-area networks, but its rapid expansion in the Chinese market is mainly due to its self-organizing, secure, and controllable features, as well as its long-range, low-power, and anti-interference technical characteristics. These features have led to successful implementations in many new vertical domains during LoRa\'s 7th year of development in China.\n\n![](https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/3b690990-9ff1fbb_0ec7a7113fc044f4880ea48584f3d68b~mv2.webp)\n\nAccording to Gan Quan, the Director of Market Strategy at Semtech, the three major characteristics of LoRa networks align with the Chinese context.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"Firstly, we can build our own network without relying on any operators or other technologies. We can establish a network ourselves and deploy it flexibly according to business models and requirements. Self-organizing networks can be combined with other networks, including 4G and 5G, to set up gateways wherever the signal is weak.\"<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"The second characteristic is security. As a physical layer communication technology, we only discuss the security of physical data transmission. Among the wireless communication technologies that people have seen and heard of, LoRa is the most secure and least susceptible to eavesdropping due to its transmission signal extension beneath the entire noise floor.\"<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"The third characteristic is the controllable low-power nature of LoRa, and chip supply and design are also controllable. In addition to Semtech, ST and Shanghai Aojie can also supply LoRa chips.\"<br/><br/>\n\n\nBased on these three major characteristics, LoRa has experienced rapid growth in the field of industrial control in the past year. It has also begun to venture into new areas such as wearable devices, delivery robots, satellite communications, and remote control devices.<br/><br/>\n\n\nOne such example is delivery robots. For delivery robots in hotels and restaurants, both positioning technology and wake-up technology are essential. However, with numerous rooms in hotels and restaurants, relying solely on Wi-Fi connections makes it difficult to achieve seamless coverage. Moreover, the abundance of Wi-Fi devices can significantly impact the connectivity, making it challenging to maintain signal stability for delivery robots.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"We need a technology that ensures signal stability and anti-interference capabilities. This is where many robot manufacturers use LoRa for coverage. With just one gateway deployed, the entire area can be covered. Users or staff only need to press a LoRa transmitter or a small button to control the movement of the robot,\" explained Gan Quan.<br/><br/>\n\n\nIn special environments like mountain marathons, LoRa technology is also applied in smart wearable devices. Mountain marathons often take place in areas without operator coverage, and setting up base stations can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, by simply installing an antenna on a control vehicle, LoRa networks can track athletes\' physical condition and location within a range of tens of kilometers, ensuring their safety.<br/><br/>\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the long-distance transmission feature of LoRa has found its latest application.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"People often ask me how far LoRa can transmit. I now answer this question by saying that, under policy conditions and compliance with national standards, LoRa can transmit at least to satellites. As a result, many satellite companies have approached us, hoping to deploy LoRa gateways on satellites,\" added Gan Quan.<br/><br/>\n\n\nTo accommodate this, Semtech has introduced the new LoRa physical layer LR-FHSS to adapt to satellite or ultra-large-capacity environments. According to reports, LoRa satellite costs are low, network configuration is simple, and devices operating at normal frequencies and transmission power can communicate with LoRa low-earth-orbit satellites within a range of 600 to 1600 kilometers.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\"We hope that the ecosystem will continue to develop, with an increasing number and variety of LoRa chip suppliers. For example, with the development of the Internet of Things, there may be more opportunities for integration, such as LoRa + Wi-Fi, LoRa + Bluetooth, and so on,\" said Zhang Hui.', 'https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/4a761739-6ff1fbb_9ff96cc53f744a19ba00597853729951~mv2.gif', 1, '2026-01-05 13:30:03', '2026-01-05 20:39:14');

Communication is essential for the development of the IoT, whether it is short-range wireless transmission technology or mobile communication technology. In communication, communication protocols are particularly important as they define the rules and agreements that entities must follow to complete communication or provide services.<br /><br />\n\n\nThis article introduces several available IoT communication protocols, each with different performance, data rates, coverage ranges, power requirements, and memory usage. Each protocol has its own advantages and, to some extent, disadvantages. Some communication protocols are only suitable for small household appliances, while others can be used for large-scale smart city projects. IoT communication protocols can be divided into two main categories:<br /><br />\n\n\nAccess protocols: Typically responsible for networking and communication between devices within a subnet.<br /><br />\n\nCommunication protocols: Mainly run on top of the traditional Internet TCP/IP protocol and are responsible for data exchange and communication between devices over the Internet.<br /><br />\n\n\n**A. Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\n**1. Long-Range Cellular Communication**<br /><br />\n\n\n(i) **2G/3G/4G** Communication Protocols: Referring to the second, third, and fourth-generation mobile communication system protocols.<br /><br />\n\n\n(ii) **NB-IoT** (Narrowband Internet of Things): NB-IoT is an important branch of the Internet of Things network. It is built on cellular networks and consumes only about 180kHz of bandwidth. It can be deployed directly on GSM, UMTS, or LTE networks to reduce deployment costs and achieve smooth upgrades. NB-IoT focuses on the Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) IoT market and is an emerging technology that can be widely applied globally. It has the characteristics of wide coverage, multiple connections, fast data rates, low cost, low power consumption, and excellent architecture.<br /><br />\n\n\nApplication scenarios: NB-IoT network enables applications such as smart parking, smart firefighting, smart water management, smart streetlights, bike sharing, and smart home appliances.<br /><br />\n\n\n(iii) **5G:** The fifth-generation mobile communication technology is the latest generation of cellular mobile communication technology. 5G aims to achieve high data rates, reduced latency, energy savings, cost reduction, increased system capacity, and massive device connectivity.<br /><br />\n\n\nApplication scenarios: AR/VR, connected vehicles, smart manufacturing, smart energy, wireless healthcare, wireless home entertainment, connected drones, ultra-high-definition/panoramic live streaming, personal AI assistants, smart cities.<br /><br />\n\n\n**2. Long-Range Non-Cellular Communication**<br /><br />\n\n\n(i) **WiFi: **Due to the rapid popularity of home WiFi routers and smartphones in recent years, the WiFi protocol has also been widely used in the smart home field. The biggest advantage of WiFi protocol is direct access to the Internet. Compared to ZigBee, WiFi-based smart home solutions eliminate the need for additional gateways, and compared to Bluetooth protocols, they eliminate the dependence on mobile terminals such as smartphones.<br /><br />\n\n\nThe commercial deployment of WiFi in public places such as urban public transportation and shopping malls demonstrates the potential of WiFi in public coverage.<br /><br />\n\n\n(ii) **ZigBee:** ZigBee is a low-speed short-range wireless communication protocol, which is a reliable wireless data transmission network. Its main features include low speed, low power consumption, low cost, support for a large number of network nodes, support for various network topologies, low complexity, fast and reliable operation, and security. ZigBee technology is a new type of technology that relies on wireless networks for transmission and can establish wireless connections at close distances.<br /><br />\n\n\nZigBee\'s inherent advantages have made it a mainstream technology in the IoT industry, with large-scale applications in industrial, agricultural, and smart home fields.<br /><br />\n\n\n(iii) **LoRa:** LoRa™ (Long Range) is a modulation technology that provides longer communication distances compared to similar technologies. LoRa is widely used in various IoT products, including LoRa gateways, smoke detectors, water monitoring, infrared detection, positioning, and smart plugs. As a narrowband wireless technology, LoRa uses time difference of arrival for geolocation. LoRa positioning applications include smart cities and traffic monitoring, metering and logistics, and agricultural monitoring.<br /><br />\n\n\n**3. Short-Range Communication**<br /><br />\n\n\n(i) **RFID:** Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses radio waves to identify and track objects. It is commonly used for inventory management, access control, and asset tracking.<br /><br />\n\n\n(ii) **NFC:** Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to establish communication by bringing them close together. NFC has features such as human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions.<br /><br />\n\n\n(iii) **Bluetooth:** Bluetooth technology is a global standard for wireless data and voice communication. It provides a special type of short-range wireless technology based on low-cost connections for fixed and mobile devices.<br /><br />\n\n\nBluetooth enables wireless information exchange between various devices, including mobile phones, PDAs, wireless headphones, laptops, and related peripherals. By using Bluetooth technology, communication between mobile communication terminals and Internet devices can be simplified, resulting in faster and more efficient data transmission and expanding the possibilities of wireless communication.<br /><br />\n\n\n**4. Wired Communication**<br /><br />\n\n\n(i) USB: USB (Universal Serial Bus) is an external bus standard that specifies the connection and communication between computers and external devices. It is widely used in the PC domain as an interface technology.<br /><br />\n\n\n(ii) Serial Communication Protocol: The serial communication protocol specifies the contents of the data packets, including start bits, payload data, parity bits, and stop bits. Both parties must agree on a consistent data packet format to communicate properly. Common protocols in serial communication include RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485.<br /><br />\n\n\nSerial communication refers to the communication between peripheral devices and computers using bit-by-bit data transmission. This communication method uses fewer data lines and can save communication costs in long-distance communication, but its transmission speed is lower than parallel transmission. Most computers (excluding laptops) have two RS-232 serial ports. Serial communication is also a commonly used communication protocol in instrument and equipment industries.<br /><br />\n\n\n(iii) Ethernet: Ethernet is a computer local area network (LAN) technology. The IEEE organization\'s IEEE 802.3 standard defines the technical standards of Ethernet, including the physical layer wiring, electronic signals, and media access control protocols.<br /><br />\n\n\n(iv) MBus: MBus (Meter-Bus) is a two-wire bus widely used for remote meter reading systems, such as heat meters and water meters, based on European standards.<br /><br />\n\n\n**B. Network Layer and Transport Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\n1. IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which is the first widely deployed version in the protocol\'s development process. IPv4 is the core of the Internet and the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol.<br /><br />\n\n\n2. IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6 is developed to address the limited network address resources of IPv4, which significantly restricts the application and development of the Internet. IPv6 solves the problem of network address resource scarcity and enables the connection of multiple devices to the Internet.<br /><br />\n\n\n3. TCP: Transmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented, reliable, byte-stream-based transport layer communication protocol. TCP is designed to adapt to the layered protocol hierarchy that supports multiple network applications. TCP provides reliable communication services between pairs of processes in computers connected to different but interconnected networks. TCP assumes that it can obtain a simple, possibly unreliable data packet service from a lower-level protocol.<br /><br />\n\n\n4. 6LoWPAN: 6LoWPAN is an IPv6-based low-power wireless personal area network standard, specifically IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4.<br /><br />\n\n\n**C. Application Layer Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\n1. MQTT Protocol: MQTT is a publish-subscribe communication protocol commonly used in machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and the Internet of Things (IoT). It is widely used in various applications, including satellite communication between sensors, occasional dial-up medical devices, smart homes, and small-scale devices.<br /><br />\n\n\n2. CoAP Protocol: CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a lightweight web-like protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks in the IoT world. It is suitable for small, low-power sensors, switches, valves, and similar components that require remote control or monitoring via standard Internet networks. CoAP does not respond to unsupported types.<br /><br />\n\n\n3. REST/HTTP Protocol: RESTful is a resource-based software architectural style. Resources refer to specific information or entities on the network, such as images or songs. RESTful APIs are implementations based on the HTTP protocol (an application-layer protocol known for its simplicity and speed).<br /><br />\n\n\nApplications or designs that conform to the REST specification are called RESTful, and APIs designed according to the REST specification are called RESTful APIs.<br /><br />\n\n\n4. DDS Protocol: DDS (Data Distribution Service) is a middleware protocol for distributed real-time data distribution services. It acts as a \"bus on the bus\" in distributed real-time networks, facilitating the interconnection of network protocols. It plays a role similar to TCP/IP in real-time networks.<br /><br />\n\n\n5. AMQP Protocol: AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an application layer standard for a message-oriented middleware that provides unified messaging services. It is an open standard for application layer protocols and enables messaging between clients and message-oriented middleware without being restricted by different client/middleware products or programming languages. Examples of AMQP implementations include RabbitMQ, which is implemented in Erlang.<br /><br />\n\n\n6. XMPP Protocol: XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is a protocol based on a subset of the XML standard, inheriting the flexibility of XML in an evolving environment. XMPP-based applications have great scalability. Extended information can be sent to meet user needs and establish applications such as content publishing systems and address-based services on top of XMPP.<br /><br />\n\n\n**D. Comparison of Some Communication Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\n**1. Comparison of NB-IoT and LoRa Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\nFirstly, in terms of frequency bands, LoRa operates in unlicensed bands below 1GHz, which does not require additional fees for application. On the other hand, NB-IoT and cellular communication using bands below 1GHz require licensing and incur fees.<br /><br />\n\n\nSecondly, in terms of battery life, LoRa modules have unique features in dealing with interference, network overlap, and scalability. However, NB-IoT, due to considerations of service quality, cannot provide the same battery life as LoRa.<br /><br />\n\n\nThirdly, in terms of device cost, LoRa protocol is simpler and easier to develop for terminal nodes. It has better compatibility with microprocessors. Low-cost and technically mature LoRa modules are already available in the market, with upgraded versions being released gradually.<br /><br />\n\n\nFourthly, regarding network coverage and deployment schedule, the NB-IoT standard was announced in 2016, and besides network deployment, additional time and effort are needed to establish commercialization and the industrial chain. The entire industrial chain of LoRa is relatively mature, and products are in a state of \"waiting for takeoff.\" Many countries worldwide are conducting or have completed nationwide network deployments.<br /><br />\n\n\n**2. Comparison of Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\nCurrently, WiFi\'s advantage lies in its widespread application, already reaching millions of households. ZigBee\'s advantage lies in its low power consumption and self-organizing network capabilities. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology excels in transmission rate. Bluetooth\'s advantage is easy networking. However, these three technologies also have their limitations, and none of them can fully meet all the requirements of smart homes.<br /><br />\n\n\nBluetooth technology enables short-range wireless communication, but its protocol is more complex, consumes more power, and has higher costs, making it less suitable for applications that require low cost and low power consumption in industrial control and home networking. One of the biggest obstacles for Bluetooth is its limited transmission range, usually around 10 meters. It also has limited resistance to interference and information security issues, which hampers its further development and large-scale applications.<br /><br />\n\n\nWiFi is also a short-range wireless transmission technology that can provide instant access to wireless signals with high mobility, making it suitable for applications in offices and homes. However, WiFi has a fatal drawback. As WiFi uses radio frequency technology to transmit data signals through the air, it is susceptible to external interference.<br /><br />\n\n\nZigBee is an internationally recognized wireless communication technology that allows each network port to connect to over 65,000 endpoints. It is suitable for various fields, including homes, industries, agriculture, etc. ZigBee has the advantages of low power consumption and low cost.<br /><br />\n\n\n**3. Comparison of MQTT and CoAP Protocols**<br /><br />\n\n\nMQTT is a many-to-many communication protocol used for message transmission between different clients through intermediate brokers. It decouples producers from consumers, allowing clients to publish messages and letting the broker handle routing and message copying. Although MQTT supports some level of persistence, it is best used as a real-time data communication bus.<br /><br />\n\n\nCoAP, on the other hand, is primarily a point-to-point protocol used for transferring status information between clients and servers. While it supports observing resources, CoAP is best suited for a state transfer model rather than event-driven operations.<br /><br />\n\n\nMQTT clients establish long-lived TCP connections, which usually pose no issues. CoAP clients and servers, on the other hand, send and receive UDP datagrams. In NAT environments, tunnels or port forwarding can be used to allow CoAP or similar types of devices such as LWM2M to initialize frontend connections.<br /><br />\n\n\nMQTT does not provide support for message typing or other metadata to aid client understanding. MQTT messages can be used for any purpose, but all clients must know the upstream data format to enable communication. CoAP, on the contrary, provides built-in support for content negotiation and discovery, allowing devices to probe each other to find the best way to exchange data.<br /><br />\n\n\nBoth protocols have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific application.<br /><br />\n\n\n**In conclusion**, the selection of IoT communication protocols depends on various factors, including the specific use case, network requirements, power consumption, coverage range, and cost considerations. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, and understanding the characteristics of different protocols is essential to make informed decisions when designing and implementing IoT solutions.', 'https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/a1248104-1ff1fbb_97426d57c69f41999274cc2ae99452c9~mv2.webp', 1, '2026-01-05 19:55:29', '2026-01-05 20:37:41');

In fact, according to a recent report by Enterprise IoT Insights, Cisco and Ericsson both predicted that by 2020, the market for interconnected devices would reach 50 billion devices. However, the growth of the entire IoT market has been slower than those predictions, with only 12.4 billion IoT devices in circulation at present, more than a year after those forecasts. Nevertheless, LPWAN solutions like LoRaWAN can easily adapt to the needs of IoT applications and have a greater impact on the massive IoT.<br /><br />\n\n\nMassive-scale IoT is composed of a large number of low-complexity, low-cost devices that connect to networks with relatively lower throughput speeds. This combination of sensor devices and networks built specifically for IoT is transforming how enterprises operate, how public infrastructure is monitored, and how organizations implement sustainable development plans. It\'s easy to see why there was such high hope for cellular networks ten years ago since cellular connectivity dominated in other types of devices. The infrastructure was already in place, so why couldn\'t it be easily leveraged to power massive-scale IoT? It seemed like the development of massive-scale IoT was just a few years away. Then a few more. Always on the horizon.<br /><br />\n\n\n**Challenges of Cellular IoT**<br /><br />\n\n\nIt turns out that the technology needed for large-scale IoT deployments did not exist when these predictions were made. Aside from other challenges, there is a mismatch between infrastructure costs, device battery life requirements, and availability. Cellular operators attempted to connect the predicted billions of devices using technologies that were not specifically built for IoT.<br /><br />\n\n\nIn the currently deployed IoT devices, 2G and 3G represent the majority of cellular IoT connections, with 53.1% using one of them. This is problematic because operators are phasing out these legacy technologies, and their replacements are still struggling to gain traction. This year, operators like AT&T and T-Mobile are shutting down their 3G networks, and 2G networks are already outdated in most regions globally, with some parts of Europe following suit. 47% of users have not received notifications about network shutdowns, creating an uncertain path forward.<br /><br />\n\n\nIn recent years, as use case requirements have become clearer, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, such as NB-IoT and Cat-M1, have seen development. However, even in their most prominent regions, challenges still persist. Take China, for example. According to internal estimates by Sequans, it is the largest and fastest-growing market for NB-IoT and Cat-M1, with 100 million cellular LPWAN chipsets sold in the region in 2020. The rest of the world is estimated to have only 5 million NB-IoT chipsets. In China, data plans and investments in infrastructure have allowed this technology to flourish, but even in China, hardware vendors are struggling to turn a profit.<br /><br />\n\n![](https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/49f2af01-6ff1fbb_d8ef8d19b26d45dd95323b91e5fd88b3~mv2.avif)\n\n\nLet\'s take a look at three cellular IoT challenges and how LoRaWAN can provide solutions.<br /><br />\n\n\n**1. Expensive Connectivity**<br /><br />\n\n\nInfrastructure costs have always been one of the biggest obstacles to deploying massive-scale IoT using cellular networks. Cellular requires expensive infrastructure to support it, including towers that cost over $100,000 to build, expensive gateways, and a significant labor force for network deployment and ongoing management. Due to the inherent deployment model of cellular networks, operators cannot build networks on demand, unlike license-free LPWAN solutions like LoRaWAN, which can easily adapt to the needs of IoT applications. The bill of materials (BOM) cost for LoRaWAN hardware is also lower, reducing the overall infrastructure and solution costs compared to cellular-based solutions.<br /><br />\n\n\nThis is not even considering the functional differences in critical areas, such as terminal device power consumption and associated costs in large-scale deployments. The communication profiles of the most common NB-IoT use cases, such as asset tracking, smart metering, and wearable devices, result in high power consumption for cellular devices. Supporting devices with higher power consumption inevitably leads to battery drain, and NB-IoT\'s inherent \"chattiness\" exacerbates this even further.<br /><br />\n\n\nAfter device deployment, firmware updates for cellular devices typically consume longer battery life compared to LoRaWAN devices, making LoRaWAN a more viable solution for projects that require longer on-site durations.<br /><br />\n\n\nAccording to Semtech, LoRaWAN has an overall operating power consumption three to five times lower than NB-IoT. The battery life of devices using NB-IoT is also not long-lasting, as ABI Research found that LoRaWAN devices average a battery life extension of over five years, providing longer lifetimes, depending on the use case. A group of researchers from the University of Bologna, University of Trento, and Integrated Systems Laboratory found that based on their experimental data using sensors for monitoring structural integrity, LoRaWAN battery life can be up to 10 times longer than NB-IoT in certain applications.<br /><br />\n\n \n\n**2. Inconsistent Coverage and Limited Choices**<br /><br />\n\n\nDue to delayed deployments of NB-IoT and Cat-M1, cellular IoT solutions have yet to be deployed on a large scale. However, LoRaWAN is experiencing rapid growth due to the flexibility of its deployment model and increasing interoperability among network operators, which will come together to provide global coverage in the near future.<br /><br />\n\n\nAccording to data from the LoRa Alliance, there are now over 160 countries with public LoRaWAN networks, while according to GSA data, 64 countries have NB-IoT or LTE-M operators. The lack of networks and interoperability issues make it more challenging to manage deployments across locations using cellular IoT technology. On the other hand, the LoRaWAN network is experiencing significant growth. With integration between various ground networks and satellite connectivity, as well as advancements like LoRa Alliance\'s LR-FHSS transmission data rate, collaborations such as the MultiTech MultiTech MultiMode IoT Connectivity (MMIIC) are paving the way for achieving 100% global coverage by 2022.<br /><br />\n\n\nMoreover, certified cellular terminal devices have been slow to market and have been negatively affected by the mentioned phasing out of 2G and 3G. In contrast, the LoRa Alliance offers a robust device certification program that provides end users with confidence that terminal devices supporting sensors are compliant with the LoRaWAN specification. Device compliance ensures proper behavior on the network, reduces support costs, and prevents failures when higher-cost fixes are needed in the future. Such policies and regulations will greatly contribute to ensuring the reliability of terminal devices expected to last for decades in the field.<br /><br />\n\n\nSome operators have even abandoned NB-IoT, like NTT DoCoMo and Dish Network did last year, focusing instead on Cat M1, LTE-M, and 5G, respectively. There is a lot of confusion about which cellular technology will prevail, and it\'s anyone\'s guess—even among mobile network operators.<br /><br />\n\n\n**3. 5G is Not the Solution**<br /><br />\n\n\nNB-IoT and Cat M1 are 4G technologies compatible with 5G, so they are riding on the hype around 5G. With the sunset of 2G and 3G approaching, 5G positions itself as the solution to fill the gap when over half of the current cellular IoT connections no longer function. However, to date, enterprise adoption has been minimal, with only 290 publicly disclosed private 5G networks deployed globally, and a noticeable decline in the application of 5G spectrum.<br /><br />\n\n\nWhile 5G supports NB-IoT and Cat M1 as cellular solutions for large-scale IoT deployments, they still have a long way to go to fill the gap. In the long run, several IoT technologies will coexist to maximize return on investment for IoT deployments. Cellular technologies will support use cases that require continuous communication, higher data rates, or lower latency, while LoRaWAN will serve as the primary technology for use cases that require long-range, deep indoor penetration, battery-powered devices, and coverage in challenging environments, as well as implementations that require a mix of public and private networks.<br /><br />\n\n\n**Connecting the Unconnected with LoRaWAN**<br /><br />\n\n\nLoRaWAN is poised to provide the cost structure and flexibility needed for large-scale IoT deployments. It offers longer range, extended battery life, better propagation characteristics, and more power-efficient maintenance, which combined can effectively support a broader range of use cases. These are some of the reasons why ABI Research predicts that by 2026, LoRaWAN will account for over half of all non-cellular LPWAN connections.<br /><br />\n\n\nThe range of LoRaWAN is particularly crucial as it can reach environments where cellular signals struggle to penetrate or where cellular infrastructure is lacking. From rural and rugged environments to indoor spaces and even deep within solid structures, LoRaWAN\'s propagation characteristics benefit everywhere.<br /><br />\n\n\nSecurity is another key differentiating factor, as cellular signals are susceptible to interception as they hop from one point to another on the network. LoRaWAN provides end-to-end security built into the protocol. LoRaWAN also supports public, private, and hybrid models, offering great flexibility in how enterprises deploy network infrastructure.<br /><br />\n\n\nWith over 500 members collaborating closely to advance an open global protocol, LoRa Alliance\'s commitment aims to support this field for over two decades, compared to the five-year cycles of introducing new and deprecating old protocols by 3GPP. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recently approved LoRaWAN as a global standard for LPWAN, further solidifying LoRaWAN\'s position as a reliable, open standard.<br /><br />\n\n\n**Endgame**<br /><br />\n\n\nTrailblazers are paving the way for the latest predictions of 1 billion LoRaWAN devices by 2025 for IoT analytics. They have the innovation, deployment models, and partnerships that the cellular market still lacks. As LoRaWAN is used with sensors that detect the physical world, sensors that can last over a decade and be updated over the air, customers are free to explore endless use cases and benefit from the insights their data can generate. The potential of massive-scale IoT is finally being unleashed.\n', 'https://ofdhq.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/assets/2026_01/49f2af01-6ff1fbb_d8ef8d19b26d45dd95323b91e5fd88b3~mv2.avif', 1, '2026-01-05 19:59:08', '2026-01-05 20:33:11');
